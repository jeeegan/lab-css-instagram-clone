      <h1>Capture and Share the World's Moments</h1>
      <p>
        Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with
        friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram
        &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.

        Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
